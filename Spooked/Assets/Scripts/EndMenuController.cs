After the Fire Departmentâ€™s timely response, investigators went to work searching the collapsed remains. \n\nAmong the destroyed lab equipment investigators procured a charred, unbound sketchbook containing pictures matching that of individuals reported missing not too long ago.\n\nOn the first page was a woman who was matched to the wife of a particular professor whom the world lost contact with a long time ago. Investigators opened an inquiry into his whereabouts.\n\nThe last page was harshly destroyed, but investigators were able to partially piece it back together. The resulting image was matched with an individual a bystander claimed they saw wandering around that building one night.\n\nOne investigator claims that they saw a large, shadowy figure run into the nearby woods, but the existence of that entity has not been confirmed.";
