## Description ##

For our project, we decided to make a first-person horror game called "Escape from Kemper".
In the game, you are walking around UC Davis's Kemper Hall after some terrible stuff took place. You can understand the story more by picking up the lore items scattered around the map. The start menu also serves as an introduction to what to what might've happened.
You are running from one room to another looking for a red book, this is your main objective as the player. However, once you find the said book, a monster spawns in the map looking for you (you just stole his precious book). So, when you pick it up, you have to escape as fast as possible before the monster catches up to you.
You can use one of the doors with the exit sign to leave the building, but keep in mind, only one of these doors is the actual exit.
If the monster catches you, game over, you lose.
If you manage to leave Kemper with the book, that's a victory.
